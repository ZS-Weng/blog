## Introduction

![Image Generated with the prompt: extracting meaningful details from documents]("Document Extract Info.png")

- RAG is one of the interesting developments
- Used to be harder to do based on a local setup but it is becoming much easier due to various technological developments
- Article is showing the best way I have found with minimum addittional installations

## Indexing and search

## Sentence Bert Transformers Model

### Pair Encoder to be used for search

### Cross Encoder for more accurate score

- Need to check on the limits of the score and what do they mean
- Potentially this can also be used as a threshold filter to take out irrelevant results to prevetn hallucination
