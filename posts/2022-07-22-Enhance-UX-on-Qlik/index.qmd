## Introduction

After the successful delivery of a data analytics product, a common challenge faced is to enhance user adoption. One of the definitions of user adoption from an Indeed article is as follows:


User adoption rates are important because they tell a company or business how many users like the new product or version and how many don’t like it or do not try it. Most often, a higher adoption rate means a customer finds both value and ease in using the new product or version. Conversely, if a customer finds it requires too much effort to use or doesn’t add value, they may abandon the product altogether or stay with an older version.

One of the necessary ingredients to a successful adoption is the user experience on the interface. In this article, I would like to cover on ways we have found useful to make dashboards on Qlik Sense Apps more intuitive and user friendly.

The three areas I would like to cover are as follows:

* Menu Page for holistic view of overall health of business




Navigation Bars for navigating between apps and within each app
