## Introduction

There are many useful applications of Regex. In this article, I would like to cover two of them commonly used for my projects in Singapore. They are

* Masking of sensitive Singapore National ID information
* Extraction of relevant date details from a text field

The full set of codes in a Jupyter Notebook format can be found in the following link <https://github.com/ZS-Weng/Data_Engineering/tree/main/Regex>



The full code for the various functions can also be found at the end of the article.
