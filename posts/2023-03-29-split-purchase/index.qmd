### Brief Overview of Procure to Pay Process

The procure to pay process is a commonly used term to describe the fulfillment of goods and/or services to a given requirement. It usually starts with having a purchase requsition or purchase request. This will be followed with a purchase order (PO) to be sent to the respective vendors for fulfilling the order. When the vendor/supplier provides the goods and/or service they would bill with an invoice and the purchasing organization will verify the receipt of the goods or services. At this stage there is usually a three way matching process to ensure the purchase order, goods receipt and invoice are aligned. The final step will be the actual payment of the goods and services.
