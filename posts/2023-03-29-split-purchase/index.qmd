## Introduction

### Brief Overview of Procure to Pay Process

The procure to pay process is a commonly used term to describe the fulfillment of goods and/or services to a given requirement. It usually starts with having a purchase requsition or purchase request. This will be followed with a purchase order (PO) to be sent to the respective vendors for fulfilling the order. When the vendor/supplier provides the goods and/or service they would bill with an invoice and the purchasing organization will verify the receipt of the goods or services. At this stage there is usually a three way matching process to ensure the purchase order, goods receipt and invoice are aligned. The final step will be the actual payment of the goods and services. 

### Issues with Split Purchase Order

Splitting of purchase orders can be considered non-compliant when it is done with the intention of circumventing the organization's internal controls or policies, or to avoid the approval process required for purchases over a certain threshold.

For example, if an organization has a policy that requires purchases over a certain amount to be approved by a specific person or department, splitting a large purchase order into multiple smaller ones to avoid the approval process can be considered non-compliant. Similarly, if splitting a purchase order results in higher costs or unnecessary duplication of effort, it can be seen as a violation of procurement regulations or internal controls.

In this article, I would like to explore some useful functions in python which could help in identifying splitting of purchase orders.

## Logic to identify Splitting of PO

In this article, I will use a simplified dataset with 8 rows of transactions, each representing a different Purchase Order. These purchase orders belong to two departments acorss four venodrs. 

![Sample Dataset](split_purchase_sample_data.png)


First, we would order the data by purchasing department, item and the purchase order date. From there we will identify the instances where the Purchasing Department is buying the same item across different purchase orders. 

```python
item_field = "Item"

df_dept_item_sorted = df_raw.sort_values(
    ["Purchasing Department", item_field, "Purchase Order Date"]
)

df_dept_item_sorted["Prev PR Date"] = df_dept_item_sorted[
    "Purchase Order Date"
].shift()

df_dept_item_sorted["PreGroup"] = (
    df_dept_item_sorted[
        ["Purchasing Department", item_field, "Purchase Order Date"]
    ]
    .groupby(["Purchasing Department", item_field])
    .cumcount()
)



```
