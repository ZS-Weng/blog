## Introduction

In a recent engagement with a team that provides secretariat service, there is an opportunity to optimize the existing process of creating meeting minutes. In the current context there is a significant time spent in listening to recorded meeting captured on a voice recorder to ensure comprehensiveness of the points captured.

At some of these offline meetings, confidential issues and sensitive data are often shared. While recording these discussions is necessary for reference, sharing such recordings over the cloud or with third-party transcription services poses security risks. Leakage of confidential information could have severe consequences.
